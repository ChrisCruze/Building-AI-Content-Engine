# AI Content Templates Guide

This document provides reusable **formats** and concrete **examples** that operationalize the system at scale across platforms and contributors. Templates translate the [[Growth-Strategy]] and [[Agent-Framework]] into actionable content structures that ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency.

> **Important**: Templates are only effective when backed by solid strategy and technical architecture. Without the foundation provided by [[Growth-Strategy]] and [[Agent-Framework]], templates will produce fast but low-quality output.

## Template Usage Overview

### Purpose of Templates

Templates serve multiple functions:
1. **Consistency**: Ensure all content follows proven structures
2. **Efficiency**: Speed up content generation with reusable formats
3. **Quality**: Guide content creation toward best practices
4. **Scalability**: Enable content production at volume
5. **Brand Alignment**: Maintain brand voice and positioning

### When to Use Templates

- **Standard Content**: Routine blog posts, social posts, newsletters
- **High-Volume Production**: When generating multiple pieces quickly
- **New Contributors**: Onboarding and training
- **Consistency Requirements**: When brand consistency is critical

### When to Deviate from Templates

- **Unique Opportunities**: Special events or campaigns
- **Experimental Content**: Testing new formats or approaches
- **Crisis Communications**: Situations requiring custom messaging
- **High-Profile Content**: Major announcements or strategic content

### Template Customization

Templates are **starting points**, not rigid constraints:
- Adapt templates to specific topics and audiences
- Modify structure when it improves engagement
- Combine elements from multiple templates
- Iterate based on performance data

## Complete Content Example: Full Workflow

This example demonstrates the complete agent workflow from research → outline → draft, showing how each agent builds on the previous one's output.

### Example: "I Downloaded a Social Dining App and Didn't Go for 6 Months"

**Context**: This content targets Never-Engaged Veterans (users who signed up but never attended) to reduce psychological friction and drive activation.

#### Step 1: Research Agent Output

```markdown
# Research – I Downloaded a Social Dining App and Didn't Go for 6 Months

## 1. Brief recap
- Topic: Why people download social dining apps but delay attending
- Audience: Never-Engaged Veterans — users who signed up weeks or months ago
- Goal: Activation — reduce psychological friction
- City / focus area: NYC (young professionals, 25–35)

## 2. Search landscape
- [Multiple URLs with angle, strength, gap analysis]

## 3. Keywords & intent
- Primary keyword: social dining app
- Secondary keywords: dinner with strangers NYC; making friends as an adult NYC
- Search intent: Exploratory / emotional validation + light how-to

## 4. Surprising / non-obvious insights
1. People don't avoid social events because they're antisocial — they avoid uncertainty.
2. The longer someone waits after signing up, the harder it feels to go.
3. First attendance is triggered by emotion, not confidence.
4. Anxiety peaks before arrival, not during the event.
5. Confession builds more trust than instruction.

## 5. Data & stats
- 61% of adults report feeling lonely at least sometimes
- Anxiety is highest before social events, not during
- NYC has one of the highest rates of single-person households

## 6. Event scan
- Time Out NYC Supper Clubs
- Eventbrite "Dinner with Strangers"
- Meetup food groups

## 7. Anecdote prompts
- "I downloaded the app, scrolled, and closed it… for months."
- "The exact excuse I kept telling myself not to go."
- "What I imagined the dinner would be like vs what it was."
```

```markdown

2. I Signed Up for a Social Dining App… Then Avoided It for Half a Year

## 3. Hook ideas
- Surprising stat about loneliness or anticipatory anxiety
- Mini anecdote: scrolling, saving, closing the app
- Big question: Why is downloading easy but going hard?

## 4. Structure

### H2: I Didn't Avoid the App — I Avoided the Uncertainty
- Purpose: Reframe hesitation as emotional
- Key points: ambiguity, imagined outcomes
- Insight: uncertainty avoidance
- Anecdote: browsing without RSVP
- App tie-in: saving dinners

### H2: The Longer I Waited, the Bigger It Felt
- Purpose: Normalize delay
- Key points: guilt loop, shame
- Insight: delay increases stakes
- Anecdote: almost deleting app

### H2: What Finally Changed Wasn't Confidence — It Was a Bad Tuesday
- Purpose: Show emotional trigger

- Anecdote: last-minute RSVP

## 5. Conclusion plan
- Core takeaway: shrink uncertainty, not fear
- Emotional note: quiet pride
- CTA: pick one nearby dinner this week
```

#### Step 3: Writer Agent Output

```markdown
# I Downloaded a Social Dining App and Didn't Go for 6 Months — Here's What Finally Got Me Out the Door

> Meta title: I Downloaded a Social Dining App and Didn't Go for 6 Months — Here's Why
> Meta description: I signed up for a social dining app and avoided my first dinner for months. Here's what finally got me out the door — and why hesitation is normal.

## Intro

I downloaded the social dining app with good intentions.
I scrolled through dinners. I bookmarked a few. I imagined myself going "sometime soon."

Then I closed the app.

I did that for six months.

Not because I wasn't interested. Not because I don't like people. But because every time I thought about actually going, my brain filled in a thousand unanswered questions.

## I Didn't Avoid the App — I Avoided the Uncertainty

I wasn't scared of dinner. I was scared of not knowing what dinner would be like.

Would it be awkward? Would everyone else already know each other? Would I be stuck there longer than I wanted?

That uncertainty did all the work.

## The Longer I Waited, the Bigger It Felt

After a while, waiting added pressure. The app became a quiet reminder of something I hadn't done.

I almost deleted it — not because I disliked it, but because keeping it felt uncomfortable.

## What Finally Changed Wasn't Confidence — It Was a Bad Tuesday

Nothing heroic happened.

Plans fell through. I felt bored and lonely. I opened the app and RSVP'd to a dinner nearby.

I wasn't becoming a new person. I was just trying one night.

## Conclusion

Downloading the app isn't the hard part. Shrinking uncertainty is.

If you've been stalled for weeks or months, pick one dinner close by and treat it like an experiment.

**Call to action:**  
Open the app, choose one dinner within a few subway stops this week, and RSVP — just to see what happens.
```
