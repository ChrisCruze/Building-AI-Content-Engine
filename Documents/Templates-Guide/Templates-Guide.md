# AI Content Templates Guide

This document provides reusable **formats** and concrete **examples** that operationalize the system at scale across platforms and contributors. Templates translate the [[Growth-Strategy]] and [[Agent-Framework]] into actionable content structures that ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency.

> **Important**: Templates are only effective when backed by solid strategy and technical architecture. Without the foundation provided by [[Growth-Strategy]] and [[Agent-Framework]], templates will produce fast but low-quality output.

## Template Usage Overview

### Purpose of Templates

Templates serve multiple functions:
1. **Consistency**: Ensure all content follows proven structures
2. **Efficiency**: Speed up content generation with reusable formats
3. **Quality**: Guide content creation toward best practices
4. **Scalability**: Enable content production at volume
5. **Brand Alignment**: Maintain brand voice and positioning

### When to Use Templates

- **Standard Content**: Routine blog posts, social posts, newsletters
- **High-Volume Production**: When generating multiple pieces quickly
- **New Contributors**: Onboarding and training
- **Consistency Requirements**: When brand consistency is critical

### When to Deviate from Templates

- **Unique Opportunities**: Special events or campaigns
- **Experimental Content**: Testing new formats or approaches
- **Crisis Communications**: Situations requiring custom messaging
- **High-Profile Content**: Major announcements or strategic content

### Template Customization

Templates are **starting points**, not rigid constraints:
- Adapt templates to specific topics and audiences
- Modify structure when it improves engagement
- Combine elements from multiple templates
- Iterate based on performance data
