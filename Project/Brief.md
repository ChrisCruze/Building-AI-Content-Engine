# Brief

## What this is
A compressed, high-signal statement of what this project is about.
This is the source of clarity and focus.

## How to use
- Keep it short and opinionated
- Remove anything non-essential
- Re-read before working on the project

## Why this exists
Clarity beats effort. This prevents scope creep and misalignment.
If this is clear, execution is fast.

## How to update
- Edit ruthlessly
- Revise when priorities change
- Treat length as a constraint

## Key questions
- What problem am I solving?
- What does success look like?
- What is explicitly *not* included?
- What matters most right now?
