The purpose of this project is to essentially create a content marketing plan using AI by using the best practices and developing a process to leverage AI to build content and generate content on social media or other platforms that way. We can build an engaging, interesting funnel based on current events and other best practices, such as whether that's a blog or any other content generation practices, and identifying what would be a good use case for a social dating platform that strives to improve the marketing and have a greater impact on getting people to sign up for the platform. 

Well, success is building an engine that can craft well-crafted blog articles and content that can be put on different social media platforms. The stakeholders are the users of the platform, as well as the CEO of the platform, and other people. It could even create a newsletter that can be sent out on a regular basis. 

The resources required would be more an LLM suite tool, whether that's ChatGPT, OpenAI, or Claude. Tools like N8n could be leveraged as well. 

The key actions to perform are:
1. More research is needed in order to understand what are the best practices that need to be done.

A successful outcome is one where we have a well-defined plan and a system in place to execute.
