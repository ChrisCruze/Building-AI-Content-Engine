# Combined Project Document

## Brief

---

# Brief

## What this is
A compressed, high-signal statement of what this project is about.
This is the source of clarity and focus.

## How to use
- Keep it short and opinionated
- Remove anything non-essential
- Re-read before working on the project

## Why this exists
Clarity beats effort. This prevents scope creep and misalignment.
If this is clear, execution is fast.

## How to update
- Edit ruthlessly
- Revise when priorities change
- Treat length as a constraint

## Key questions
- What problem am I solving?
- What does success look like?
- What is explicitly *not* included?
- What matters most right now?

---



## Intent

---

The narrative anchor of the project. This field explains why the project exists and what success looks like when it's complete. It combines purpose and vision into a single, coherent story that justifies the project and sets direction.

Why does this project matter right now?
What problem does it solve or opportunity does it unlock?
What does the world look like when this project is successfully completed?
What feels different once this is done?
If I reread this in a year, would it still make sense why I cared?



## Outcome

---

The definitive definition of completion. This field describes the concrete, observable condition that marks the project as finished, with no ambiguity or debate. If this condition is met, the project is done.

Questions to answer:
- How will I know, without arguing with myself, that this project is complete?
- What must exist in the real world for this to be considered finished?
- What would an external reviewer look for to confirm completion?
- What does "not done yet" clearly look like?



## Context

---

# Context

## What this is
The surrounding reality of the project.
Facts, constraints, dependencies, and environment.

## How to use
- Capture stable truths and current state
- Focus on "what's true," not opinions
- Use to quickly re-enter the project after time away

## Why this exists
Projects stall when context is lost.
This minimizes confusion and cognitive reload time.

## How to update
- Update when facts change
- Keep it factual and current
- Avoid narrative or speculation

## Key questions
- Who is involved and what do they care about?
- What constraints exist?
- What dependencies or timelines matter?
- What resources are available or missing?

## Narrative

---

# Narrative

## What this is
A living explanation of how this project evolved.
This captures reasoning, learning, and changes in perspective.

## How to use
- Write in paragraphs
- Explain *why* decisions were made
- Capture tradeoffs, reversals, and insights
- Update as your understanding changes

## Why this exists
Future-you should understand not just what happened, but why.
This reduces rethinking, doubt, and decision fatigue.

## How to update
- Revise, don't just append
- Reflect when something changes
- Keep it human and honest

## Key questions
- Why does this project exist?
- What did I believe initially—and what changed?
- What did I learn that matters?
- What tradeoffs am I consciously making?

## Current Narrative



## Actions

---

The living working area of the project. This field contains ideas, approaches, decisions, and concrete next actions. It is expected to evolve continuously as thinking improves and work progresses.

Questions to answer:
- What are all the ideas I have for approaching this project?
- What is the very next concrete action I can take?
- What decisions need to be made?
- What risks, unknowns, or dependencies exist?
- What can move this project forward right now?



## Dossier

---

The purpose of this project is to essentially create a content marketing plan using AI by using the best practices and developing a process to leverage AI to build content and generate content on social media or other platforms that way. We can build an engaging, interesting funnel based on current events and other best practices, such as whether that's a blog or any other content generation practices, and identifying what would be a good use case for a social dating platform that strives to improve the marketing and have a greater impact on getting people to sign up for the platform. 

Well, success is building an engine that can craft well-crafted blog articles and content that can be put on different social media platforms. The stakeholders are the users of the platform, as well as the CEO of the platform, and other people. It could even create a newsletter that can be sent out on a regular basis. 

The resources required would be more an LLM suite tool, whether that's ChatGPT, OpenAI, or Claude. Tools like N8n could be leveraged as well. 

The key actions to perform are:
1. More research is needed in order to understand what are the best practices that need to be done.

A successful outcome is one where we have a well-defined plan and a system in place to execute.

# Building AI Content Engine

Create a content marketing plan using AI by leveraging best practices and developing a process to build engaging, interesting content for social media and other platforms. Build an engaging funnel based on current events and best practices (blogs, content generation) to improve marketing and increase sign-ups for a social dating platform.

## Brief

The purpose of this project is to essentially create a content marketing plan using AI by using the best practices and developing a process to leverage AI to build content and generate content on social media or other platforms that way. We can build an engaging, interesting funnel based on current events and other best practices, such as whether that's a blog or any other content generation practices, and identifying what would be a good use case for a social dating platform that strives to improve the marketing and have a greater impact on getting people to sign up for the platform.

## Purpose

Create a content engine that can craft well-crafted blog articles and content that can be put on different social media platforms. The system should be able to create newsletters that can be sent out on a regular basis, driving user engagement and sign-ups for the platform.

## Vision

Success is building an engine that can craft well-crafted blog articles and content that can be put on different social media platforms. The stakeholders are the users of the platform, as well as the CEO of the platform, and other people. It could even create a newsletter that can be sent out on a regular basis.
