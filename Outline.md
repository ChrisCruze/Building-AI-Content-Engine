# Outline

## Logline
Building AI Content Engine is a comprehensive system for generating engaging, strategic content at scale using multi-agent AI orchestration. This outline documents the five core documents that define the system: strategic foundation, technical requirements, system architecture, agent framework, and operational templates.

1. [[Growth-Strategy]] - Define why content exists, who it's for, and how it drives measurable growth.
   1.1 Purpose and Success Definition - Strategic foundation for all content generation, alignment on purpose and success metrics.
   1.2 Audience Segments and User Motivations - Core user segments (Social Connectors, Food Enthusiasts, Urban Professionals, New City Residents) and their content needs.
   1.3 Platform Positioning and Differentiation - What makes social dining distinct, positioning statement, differentiation from competitors.
   1.4 Content Goals and KPIs - Primary goals (awareness, education, engagement, activation, retention) and key performance indicators.
   1.5 Research and Signal Sources - Primary research sources (user research, market research, content performance data) and signal sources for content ideas.
   1.6 Content Funnel and Channel Roles - Content funnel stages (awareness, consideration, decision, activation, retention) and channel-specific roles (blog, social media, newsletter, platform pages).
   1.7 Brand Voice, Tone, and Guardrails - Brand voice characteristics, tone guidelines by content type, content guardrails and sensitive topics.

2. [[Technical-Specification]] - Translate strategy into testable, engineering-readable requirements.
   2.1 Scope and System Goals - System scope (content generation, research, refinement, distribution, scheduling) and system goals (quality, volume, consistency, efficiency, adaptability).
   2.2 Content Generation Requirements - Content types (blog articles, social media posts, newsletter content) with specifications for each.
   2.3 Content Quality Requirements - Minimum quality standards (grammar, brand voice compliance, factual accuracy, originality, readability) and content scoring criteria.
   2.4 Input/Output Definitions - Input sources (strategic inputs, research signals, content requests, performance feedback) and output formats.
   2.5 Automation and Review Thresholds - Automated publishing criteria, human review triggers, quality gates.
   2.6 Performance and Scalability Requirements - Response time requirements, throughput requirements, scalability targets.
   2.7 Constraints and Assumptions - Technical constraints, business constraints, assumptions about the system.

3. [[System-Architecture]] - Explain how the system is built and how data flows through it.
   3.1 High-Level System Overview - Architecture principles (modularity, scalability, reliability, observability, flexibility) and system architecture diagram.
   3.2 Core Components and Responsibilities - Research Layer (signal collectors, processors, aggregator, trend analyzer), Generation Layer (agent orchestrator, content agents, prompt manager, LLM interface), Refinement Layer (quality scorer, editor agent, fact checker).
   3.3 Data Ingestion and Research Flow - How signals are collected, processed, and aggregated into actionable insights.
   3.4 Content Generation and Refinement Flow - How content is generated by agents, refined for quality, and validated.
   3.5 Distribution and Publishing Flow - How content is formatted, scheduled, and distributed to various channels.
   3.6 Reliability, Scaling, and Risk Management - Error handling, retry logic, rate limiting, monitoring and alerting, backup and recovery.

4. [[Agent-Framework]] - Define the intelligence layer: which agents exist and how they collaborate.
   4.1 Overview of Multi-Agent Approach - Why multi-agent (complexity, quality, maintainability, flexibility, scalability) and agent architecture principles.
   4.2 Agent Roles and Responsibilities - Orchestrator Agent (coordinates workflow), Research Agent (gathers context), Writer Agent (generates drafts), Editor Agent (refines content), Quality Agent (evaluates quality), Formatter Agent (formats for channels).
   4.3 Agent Inputs, Outputs, and Constraints - Detailed specifications for each agent's inputs, outputs, and operational constraints.
   4.4 Agent Interaction and Sequencing - How agents collaborate, workflow sequences, error handling between agents.
   4.5 Prompt Evolution and Evaluation Strategy - How prompts are managed, versioned, and improved based on performance.

5. [[Templates-Guide]] - Provide reusable formats and concrete examples for operationalization.
   5.1 Template Usage Overview - Purpose of templates (consistency, efficiency, quality, scalability, brand alignment) and when to use or deviate from templates.
   5.2 Blog Content Templates - Standard blog article template, how-to guide template, listicle template, case study template.
   5.3 Social Media Templates - Platform-specific templates (Instagram, Twitter/X, Facebook, LinkedIn, TikTok) with examples.
   5.4 Newsletter Templates - Newsletter structure template, section templates (header, featured story, event highlights, community section, footer).
   5.5 Annotated Examples - Real examples with annotations explaining why they work.
   5.6 Customization and Iteration Guidance - How to adapt templates, when to create new templates, how to iterate based on performance.
