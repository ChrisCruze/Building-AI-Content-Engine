The definitive definition of completion. This field describes the concrete, observable condition that marks the project as finished, with no ambiguity or debate. If this condition is met, the project is done.

Questions to answer:
- How will I know, without arguing with myself, that this project is complete?
- What must exist in the real world for this to be considered finished?
- What would an external reviewer look for to confirm completion?
- What does "not done yet" clearly look like?
