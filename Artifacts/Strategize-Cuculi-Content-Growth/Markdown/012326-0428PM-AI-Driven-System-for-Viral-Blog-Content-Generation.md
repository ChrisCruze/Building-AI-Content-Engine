## Summary

A multi-agent workflow combines specialized drafting, calibrated provocation, and real-time MongoDB event data to create high-performing content.

## Description

A framework slide outlining a three-part methodology for automated, high-impact blog writing.

## Insight

Provocative content drives virality, but long-term success requires balancing emotional intensity with brand credibility to avoid reputational damage.

## Input

Agents

- Custom agents for each writing stage
  - Each step of the blog process uses a dedicated agent—research, outline, drafting, and titles—configured with custom prompts and executed in a sequential workflow.
  - Using an agent.md-based setup, each agent is customized with a specific prompt and role—such as credibility-focused research, structured outlining, clear drafting, and strong title creation—and then run in sequence, creating a fast, disciplined blog workflow that maintains quality and supporting evidence.
- Provocation without brand damage
  - Provocative content spreads fastest when it triggers strong emotion without sacrificing trust or long-term credibility.
    - Virality favors emotionally intense, provocative content, but long-term success comes from challenging ideas and systems while preserving credibility and audience trust.
      - While platforms reward provocative, high-arousal content—especially outrage—lasting influence comes from directing that emotional intensity toward challenging assumptions, offering practical value, and reinforcing trust, allowing creators to go viral without eroding their brand or future opportunities.
- Event-driven blogs with MongoDB
  - MongoDB powers real, relevant blog content
  - By pulling real events, users, and social dining data from MongoDB, blogs can be tightly aligned with actual experiences, making them more engaging, readable, and useful.
  - When MongoDB is used as a source of real events, users, and attendance history, blogs can promote upcoming events, highlight new joiners or seasonal moments, and reflect real experiences, increasing perceived value, engagement, and the likelihood that readers connect with and attend events.
