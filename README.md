# Building AI Content Engine

## Overview
A comprehensive system for generating engaging, strategic content at scale using multi-agent AI orchestration. The system creates well-crafted blog articles, social media posts, and newsletters that drive user engagement and sign-ups for Cuculi, a social dining platform.

## Core Idea and Outcomes
Build an AI-powered content engine that leverages best practices and multi-agent orchestration to produce high-quality, brand-aligned content across multiple channels. The system transforms content creation from manual writing into a scalable, automated process that responds to current events, user needs, and platform data.

By the end, users will be able to:
- Generate blog articles, social media posts, and newsletters at scale
- Maintain brand consistency and voice across all content types
- Respond to signals and trends automatically
- Produce content that drives measurable growth (sign-ups, engagement, platform usage)
- Operate with minimal human intervention while maintaining quality standards

## Audience and Voice
- **Audience**: Content team, growth marketers, product managers, engineering teams working on content generation systems
- **Voice**: Strategic, technical, practical, and structured—balancing high-level vision with actionable implementation details
- **Constraints**: Focus on scalable systems over one-off content; emphasize automation and quality gates; maintain brand alignment as non-negotiable

## Repository Map
- `README.md`: Overview, workflow, status, and navigation guide
- `Outline.md`: Structure of documents and sections with numbered list format
- `Facts.md`: Canonical names, terms, constraints, and project facts
- `Documents/`: One markdown file per main document (Growth Strategy, Technical Specification, System Architecture, Agent Framework, Templates Guide)
- `Report.md`: Project metrics, time logs, and artifacts
- `Blog.md`: Narrative blog post about the project journey

## Workflow (For Me and Agents)
1. If any canonical detail changed, update `Facts.md` first.
2. Update or refine the relevant document/section in `Outline.md`.
3. Draft or revise the corresponding document in `Documents/`.
4. Run an editing pass; then commit changes.

> When using an LLM: always load this README plus `Outline.md`, `Facts.md`, and the specific document file.

## Status
- [x] Document: Growth Strategy – Strategic foundation for all content generation
- [x] Document: Technical Specification – Engineering-readable requirements
- [x] Document: System Architecture – Technical implementation details
- [x] Document: Agent Framework – Multi-agent system design
- [x] Document: Templates Guide – Operational templates and examples
- [ ] System: Implementation – Build and deploy content engine
- [ ] System: Testing & Refinement – Validate content quality and system performance

## Current Focus
Working on: Repository structure and documentation – Outline.md, Facts.md, README.md, and Blog.md creation.

## Key Documents

The AI Content System Documentation Suite consists of five critical documents:

1. **[[Growth-Strategy]]** - Defines why content exists, who it's for, and how it drives measurable growth
2. **[[Technical-Specification]]** - Translates strategy into testable, engineering-readable requirements
3. **[[System-Architecture]]** - Explains how the system is built and how data flows
4. **[[Agent-Framework]]** - Defines the intelligence layer: which agents exist and how they collaborate
5. **[[Templates-Guide]]** - Provides reusable formats and concrete examples for operationalization

All documents are located in `Documents/[Document-Name]/[Document-Name].md` and are cross-referenced using `[[Document-Name]]` notation.

## Success Criteria

The project will be considered successful when:

1. **Well-Defined Plan**: Complete strategic framework for AI-powered content creation
2. **System in Place**: Operational content generation system ready for execution
3. **Key Documents Complete**: All five core documents finalized
4. **Content Quality**: System produces well-crafted, engaging content suitable for multiple platforms
5. **Automation Ready**: Process can generate content on a regular basis without constant manual intervention

## Stakeholders

- **Platform Users**: Target audience for content
- **CEO**: Strategic alignment and positioning
- **Content Team**: Execution and content creation
- **Growth Marketer/Head of Marketing**: Strategy and audience insights (Accountable Owner for Growth Strategy)
- **Product Manager**: User insight and platform positioning
- **Engineering Team**: Technical implementation and system architecture

## Resources

- **LLM Tools**: ChatGPT, OpenAI, Claude
- **Automation**: N8n for workflow orchestration
- **Research**: Best practices in content marketing, social media strategies, content funnels
- **Platform Knowledge**: Understanding of social dining platform user motivations and behaviors
