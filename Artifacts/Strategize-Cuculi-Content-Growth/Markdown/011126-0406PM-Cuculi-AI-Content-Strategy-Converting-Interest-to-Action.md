# Cuculi AI Content Growth Strategy 2025

> **“The single most important document for content-driven growth.”**
> 
> *Last Updated: January 11, 2026*  
> *Status: Foundation Strategy Document*

## Executive Summary

This strategy defines how Cuculi leverages AI to generate personalized, scalable content that drives measurable growth across the user journey. Based on analysis of 9,260 users, 4,524 events, and 88 restaurant partners, this document provides a data-driven framework for converting downloads into active participants while reducing the 50% user drop-off rate.

**Critical Challenge**: Only 50.13% of users who sign up ever attend an event. 4,739 users (51%) are classified as “High Risk - Never Engaged,” representing significant untapped potential.

**Strategic Opportunity**: AI-powered content can address the three primary conversion barriers:

1. **Choice Paralysis**: Too many undifferentiated events cause browse-to-abandon behavior
1. **Social Anxiety**: Fear of meeting strangers prevents commitment despite initial interest
1. **Value Confusion**: Users don’t understand unique benefits vs. other social platforms
