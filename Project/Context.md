# Context

## What this is
The surrounding reality of the project.
Facts, constraints, dependencies, and environment.

## How to use
- Capture stable truths and current state
- Focus on "what's true," not opinions
- Use to quickly re-enter the project after time away

## Why this exists
Projects stall when context is lost.
This minimizes confusion and cognitive reload time.

## How to update
- Update when facts change
- Keep it factual and current
- Avoid narrative or speculation

## Key questions
- Who is involved and what do they care about?
- What constraints exist?
- What dependencies or timelines matter?
- What resources are available or missing?
